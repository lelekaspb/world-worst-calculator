The calculator has a list of results, two input-fields, a drop-down-selector, and a “calculate”-button.

Normal operation is that the user enters one number in the first input-field, selects the operator (+, –, \*, or / for add, subtract, multiply or divide), then enters another number in the second input-field, and presses the “calculate”-button.

That calculates the result of the operation, and writes the result into the first input-field, so that it can be used as input for the next operation.

It also writes the result to the end of the list of results.

An additional feature is that the user can set the “rounding” – i.e. how many digits should show after the decimal point. If selected, the rounding is set to the number of digits selected by a drop-down. It is possible to select from 0 to 8 digits.

Another extra feature is the clearing of the list of results – the user can click “clear results”, and the list is deleted – but the result in the first input-field is kept.
